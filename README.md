# Kaggle Projects

House Price Advanced Regression Techniques by Kaggle (Python ,Lasso ,XG-Boost):
●	Identified the important features from 79 Explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes by conducting exploratory Data Analysis. Performed various algorithms like Lasso, Ridge, Elastic net, Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict the housing prices.
●	Increased Accuracy by using logarithmic functions to normalize the data and increased the accuracy by 20% by using Lasso. Predicted the house prices with a value of 0.11802 RSMLE.
